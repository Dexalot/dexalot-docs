# Dexalot Subnet Staking Incentive Launch

![incentives1](\images\incentives\incentives1.png)

Dexalot’s subnet release candidate is entering production in just over a month, and we’re proud to announce the arrival of user incentives! From #Stake2theSubnet and #Trade2theSubnet, Dexalot has offered users a new kind of incentive program. Stakers have received exceptionally high APRs, and leading traders have been rewarded for perfecting their trading strategies. Dexalot continues to prioritize security and reliability while offering users incentive programs that are of both high value and exceptional quality. The launch of the incentives program in conjunction with the production subnet will provide users with a taste of what’s to come from Dexalot, and we’re just getting started.

## Highlights:

* Trading fee revenue distributions for stakers starts!
* Dexalot Incentive Program (DIP) user scores begin when you deposit $ALOT into your portfolio!
* Inclusion of #Stake2theSubnet Option 2 stakers in revenue distribution is initiated!
* Trading is reliably secured on a permissioned Avalanche subnet!

## DIP Rewards:

* [DIP Rewards](https://medium.com/dexalot/the-dexalot-incentive-program-1d55c869a6c0) begin immediately on the launch of the Subnet.
* All users that trade, enter orders and deposit $ALOT will receive rewards.
* These rewards will be proportional to the amount and duration of your deposits.

## Staker Trading Fee Rewards:

* Reward distribution is open to both Option 1 and Option 2 participants in #Stake2theSubnet([#Stake2theSubnet](https://medium.com/dexalot/dexalot-stake-to-the-subnet-d3cc72ccad12)), who staked for at least two continuous months.
* Distribution begins after $100k in trading fee revenue value is aggregated.
* Option 1 stakers share 25% of the fee revenue.
* Option 2 stakers share 8% of the fee revenue.
* This distribution will be weighted by both the amount and duration of $ALOT you have deposited on the subnet.
* The total trading fee distribution will not exceed $5,000,000.
* The distribution continues for up to 1 year.

## Validators and Delegators:

* Dexalot’s permissioned subnet will be secured without external [validators](https://medium.com/dexalot/validation-the-dexalot-subnet-5621c2ee3baa) for the time being.
* Additional validation, delegation and other staking solutions will be reviewed for integration as permissionless options are engineered and become available.
* Be prepared for the Subnet incentive launch by connecting your wallet to Dexalot and depositing $ALOT. $ALOT is traded officially only on [Dexalot](https://app.dexalot.com/trade). [Learn the basics, read these articles and follow the tutorials.](https://medium.com/dexalot)
