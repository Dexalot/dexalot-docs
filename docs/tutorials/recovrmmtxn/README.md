# Pending Metamask Transactions
 how to recover
---
 Dexalot is built on top of the Avalanche network, which is clearly growing in popularity very quickly. One consequence of this growing use: gas fees can be periodically high for one app as a result of high activity on another app. When traffic is high, [transactions can be pending](https://snowtrace.io/chart/pendingtx) for longer than usual.

Dexalot itself does not have a high enough amount of activity to result in high gas costs for other apps, or cause other transactions to remain pending for long periods. If you check the [Snow Trace gas tracker](https://snowtrace.io/gastracker) , you’ll be able to see when the gas costs are high and transactions are “stuck” on the network. The Gas Tracker continuously updates the pending transactions, and sorts by the price of gas being spent for each transaction.
