an introduction — How to Use



The new Dexalot Subnet is now ready for you to test and try out!

After months of building and testing everyone can join in and enjoy the beta version of the first DeFi CLOB (central limit order book) on Avalanche.

This Avalanche Subnet is a dual-chain application containing both a Mainnet and a Subnet. By executing trades with the Dexalot token ALOT on the Dexalot Subnet, transaction gas fees are kept amazingly low. Navigate here and you are good to go.
