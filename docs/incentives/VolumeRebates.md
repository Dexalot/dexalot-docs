## ALOT Discount Fee Rates

An additional fee discount is applied based on a user's ALOT holdings. This discount is applied cumulatively i.e. if a user trades $110k and has 12k ALOT their maker discount = 8% + 6% = 14%. Current fee discounts based on end of day ALOT balance are listed below:

| ALOT EOD Balance | Maker Discount | Taker Discount |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5,000 - 10,000 | 3% | 3% |
| 10,000 - 25,000 | 6% | 6% |
| 25,000 - 50,000 | 8% | 8% |
| 50,000 - 100,000 | 11% | 11% |
| 100,000 - 250,000 | 14% | 14% |

## Fee Rebate Calculations

Please note the following details regarding fee tier calculations:
- All tier calculations occur at the end of day i.e. 00:00 UTC
- Cumulative volume is calculated by looking at the past 28 days of executions
- ALOT balances only at the end of day are used
- Processing new tiers may take up to 2 hours i.e. between 00:00 - 02:00 UTC users may still be on previous discount fee rate until all processing is complete
